BUGS
- LY increases too quickly (repo: breakpoint at 0x022F. bgb has LY=0x3E, mine has LY=0x92
- "OAM Search found these 10 visible objects:" log displayed when it shouldn't have
- STAT register isn't updated correctly.

- *** ACTUALLY WORKS **** IF register is not being updated correctly
  Repo: Set addr bp to 0x027B. IF should be 0xE1
  -- The upper nibble are all unused. So the used part is correct..
