```
Please note this project is heavily under development and very much a work in progress. It requires extensive refactoring in order to achieve any semblance of production-ready code quality. It will get there.

## Background

This is **only** the Emulator backend and doesn't comprise any code to actually render pixels to a screen. For that please see
[gameboy-ts-web](https://github.com/miwest929/gameboy-ts-web)


### Emulator Backend
`src/app/gameboy.ts` is the entry point for the emulator backend
You can run the backend indepdendently for developing and debugging reasons. But no graphics
will be rendered as that's handled solely by the frontend
